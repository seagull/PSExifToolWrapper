# PSExifToolWrapper
PSExifToolWrapper, or "seagull's EXIFTool Wrapper", is a PowerShell script that places a shortcut on the user's Desktop, onto which they can drag-and-drop files, folders, or both. The files dragged will then be run past Phil Harvey's [ExifTool](https://www.exiftool.org), with the user being prompted to either display the files' metadata, write the files' metadata to a text file, or scrub it altogether.  
_tl;dr: You can use this to display a file's metadata without learning any command-line flags_

## Features
- Downloads ExifTool automatically
- Keeps ExifTool up-to-date
- Searches recursively through folders dragged onto Desktop shortcut
- Can scrub the metadata off a file without having to remember the command-line flags
- Attempts to work around ExifTool's filename limitations (but not when scrubbing)
- Features not part of EXIFTool:
    - **Detects and displays NTFS Alternative Data Streams**
    - **Detects and displays Digital Signatures**
    - **Displays SHA1 and SHA256 file hashes**

## Installation & Usage
- Download the .zip file and extract the PS1
- Right-click the Start menu and open PowerShell as an Administrator
- Type in `Set-ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted` and use Y or A to confirm
  - (The Powershell.png file in the .zip file says basically the same thing)
- Place the .ps1 file in a folder, ideally one made specifically for it, somewhere your account has write access
  - (ie **NOT Program Files**)
- Right-click it and select "Run with PowerShell"
  - _Administrator privileges not required_
- The script will produce a shortcut on the Desktop called "EXIFTool"
- Launch the wrapper by dragging a file, a folder, or a combination onto that shortcut to see files' metadata

_Doesn't disabling my PowerShell execution policy pose a security risk?_
- No

## Considerations & Shortcomings
The wrapper script does its best to work around ExifTool's weaknesses with regards to filenames containing uncommon characters (eg, anything outside of [this Unicode block](https://jrgraphix.net/r/Unicode/0020-007F)), but that doesn't go as far as for scrubbing.
Sorry. You'll have to rename your files to be more boring. It'll work fine for analysis, though.

**Scrubbing does not remove NTFS Alternative Data Streams or Digital Signatures.**

I have done my best to make the script PowerShell 2.0-compatible, but I do this more as a point of pride than for any specific reason.
Feel free to run this on your ZX Spectrum but don't complain if it doesn't work.

I use the buttons Q, A and Z when I write scripts with prompts because my keyboard doesn't have labels on it and those buttons are at the leftmost so they're the easiest to peck.
It might feel a little unintuitive at first but you'll get used to it.  
My condolences to AZERTY typists. Feel free to leave an issue case, but don't worry about using fullstops ‚Äì I'd hate to make you use your SHIFT keys.

## Changelog
* Build 21: Initial release
* Build 22: Made it so you can mash ENTER to analyse a file instead of forcing you to press Q
* Build 24: Added support for finding NTFS Alternative Data Streams, a feature EXIFTool bafflingly does not include
* Build 33:
  - Exiting the tool now closes the command window instead of making _you_ do it
  - We now pull **digital signatures** from applicable files (another feature ExifTool inexplicably lacks)
  - We now automatically pull data if only one file was loaded in, with a subsequent choice to scrub the metadata or load it into a file (no more mashing the ENTER key)
  - We now display the version of EXIFTool present on the device before updating it
  - Writing a report to a file now produces a slick file-picker instead of forcing you to enter a file path
* Build 35:
  - SHA1/SHA256 filehashes/checksums are now calculated
  - Running the PS1 file with no arguments will recreate the shortcut on the Desktop (useful when updating wrapper versions)
* Build 45:
  - New build compatible with the weird new Strawberry Perl x86/x64 builds offered on ExifTool.org
* Build 46:
  - Added `varNoInternet` flag to top of script which can be set to `TRUE` to disable attempts to access the internet
    (You will need it enabled at least once in order to _actually download_ EXIFTool)
* Build 50:
  - Fixed various issues making text output suck; now text reports work properly with no errors
  - Errors reading non-existent ADS data are now properly, ùíàùíìùíÇùíÑùíÜùíáùíñùíçùíçùíö, caught
  - Social media link transferred from the fascist website to bSky
